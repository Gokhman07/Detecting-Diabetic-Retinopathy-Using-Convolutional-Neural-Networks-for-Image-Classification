# Detecting-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Image-Classification
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes that can lead to vision loss and blindness if not detected and treated early. As such, early diagnosis and screening for DR are critical in managing the disease and preventing vision loss. With the advent of advanced imaging technologies and machine learning algorithms, there is an opportunity to automate the detection and classification of DR using computer vision. This research focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms for the detection of DR, particularly the use of classification models trained on retinal images. We will explore the different methods and techniques used in the detection and classification of DR, as well as the potential impact of this technology on the diagnosis and treatment of DR.
